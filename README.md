# Angular-signals
Project to test out Angular signals and their descr.

Will also include notes for:
* Signals
* v16/17 unit testing changes

Maybe if I get far with this, maybe it will be used as sort of reference/homework for other developers how to
adjust to these changes, save time to deal with this topics and make relevant decision which way to go with.
