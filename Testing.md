# Testing

The following file will contain informaiton about testing since version v16/v17

Whereas Karma is being depracted and replacements are:
* Modern Web - browser-like
* Jest - browseless

Will includes experience of other developers - reddit, stackoverflow, etc..

## Jest

Features(Pros-Cons):
* Fast(er)
* Browser-less

* Sorta mut like tool
* Not fully supporting ES Modules(Should be dealt by angular itself - experimental mode thingy)

## Web test runner (Modern Web)

Features(Pros-Cons):
* Browser based
* Runs in full DOM enviroment
* Parially using dom


I pulled information from multiple sources:
* https://dev.to/konnorrogers/why-jest-is-not-for-me-46c5 ( react app view on the jest - take look at comments)
* https://dev.to/this-is-angular/angular-testing-in-2023-past-present-and-future-j5m
* https://blog.angular.io/moving-angular-cli-to-jest-and-web-test-runner-ef85ef69ceca
  * Mentioned that there is plan to make migration from karma -> moder-web as seemless as possible with ng update
